# Digital Demography (Population Data and Science)
**European Doctoral School of Demography 2022**
*February 21-25 2022*

In this repo you will find all the materials needed to complete this week's course, including the syllabus, readings, and the data and instructions for the final assignment. 

## Course description

Rapid increases in computational power and the growing access to the internet, social media and mobile phones use have radically changed our lives, the way we interact with each other and our behavior, including demographic choices. The digitalization of our lives has also led to the so-called “data revolution” that is transforming social sciences. In this course,  participants will learn how  traditional  methods  used  in  social  sciences  can help  us  make  sense  of  new  data  sources,  and  how  these  new  data  sources  may  require new conceptual and methodological approaches.

## Goals

We  will  discuss  a  number  of  substantive  topics  related  to  the emergence of (big) data-driven discovery in the social sciences, with emphasis on population processes. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with relevant literature at the intersection of demographic research and digital  social science. The main goals of the course are to introduce students

1. to recent substantive advances in the field of Digital and Computational Demography;

2. to some  of  the  methods,  approaches  and  tools  of data  science  in  the  context  of population  research; and

3. to induce critical thinking about modern demographic analysis and (online) data-driven discovery

## Online lectures

All lectures will be on Zoom, on the EDSD group. Students are expected to attend all sessions remotely. 
Please get in touch with the course conveyor in advance if you anticipate issues with this.


Best of luck!
