# Introduction to Digital Demography

## Who's in the (Zoom breakout) room?

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

1. Introduce yourself (if needed)
1. Describe your research interests using ONLY three keywords
1. What is 'digital demography'?
1. Have you ever worked with digital or online data? When?

## Digital and computational demography

1. Apply formal demography to digital trace data\footnote{Cesare, N., Lee, H., McCormick, T., Spiro, E., and Zagheni, E. (2018). Promises and pitfalls of using digital traces for demographic research. Demography 55(5):1979–1999.}
   1. "Digital censuses'' in Facebook and Linkedin
   1. Life tables to estimate *survival* within platforms (users are *born* and *die*)
1. Advance theory\footnote{Edelmann, A., Wolff, T., Montagne, D., and Bail, C.A. (2020). Computational Social Science and Sociology. Annual Review of Sociology 46(1):61–81.}
   1. Demographic (*holy trinity*: mortality, fertility, migration)
   1. Sociological theory (explain social action)

## What is 'digital' demography?

- Digital vs analogue
- Online vs offline
- 'Big' vs 'small' data

![](resources/alburez.PNG){width=375px}

## Digital data sources for demographic research


1. Digital Trace Data (online and offline)
   a. Social media
   a. Mobile phones
   a. Wearable devices, etc...
1. Crowd-sourced online data 
   a. Wikipedia
   a. DNA and online genealogies
   a. Petitions, etc...
1. Simulations (made-up data)

## Is 'Big data' new data?

## Big data for social research: the good

- big
- always-on
- nonreactive

\tiny Salganik, M. (n.d.). Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

## Big data for social research: the bad

- incomplete
- inaccessible
- nonrepresentative (within- and out-of sample)
- drifting (population, behavioural, system)
- algorithmically confounded (observing a casino)
- inaccessible
- dirty
- sensitive
