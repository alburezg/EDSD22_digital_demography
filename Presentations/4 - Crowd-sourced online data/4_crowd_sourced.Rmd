## Agenda

1. Q&A
1. Crowd-sourced data
1. **Break**
1. User-generated family trees
1. Limitations and bias

## Q&A

- Questions about the assignment
- Questions about the study last week
- Other?

# Crowd-sourced data

## What is crowd-sourced data?

- 'Bottom-up' user-generated content
- Usually large
- Available online - may have been produced offline
- By-product of decentralized activity

## Examples in this session

1. Recruitment platforms
1. Family history research

## Group discussion

Consider this image of Twitter user demographics:

1. Do you see anything odd?
1. What might be causing the issue?

## Online recruitment + post-stratification

# Online genealogies

## A genealogy is the history of a population

## WikiTree

## Geni.com: a social network for genealogists

## Built on top of (private) genomic data

## Our example: Familinx data

1. Genealogy-driven social media data
1. Goal: register entire population of the world
1. 86M unique profiles over last 400 years
1. Curated, with quality checks
1. Geo-coded events - 55% Europe; 30% North America

## Correcting bias: an example using post-stratification weights

**Starting point**:
Online genealogies are a non-representative sample of real-world genealogies.

- Online genealogies $\neq$ offline genealogies
- Unknown `weights' - derive from comparison to trusted sources 
- Understand data-generating process

## Group discussion

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

Think about a way in which you could use crowd-sourcing in your own research.

1. Which platform would you use?
1. Which challenges do you foresee?
1. Special measures to protect privacy?
